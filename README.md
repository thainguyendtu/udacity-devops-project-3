Prerequisites
AWS Account with necessary permissions for CodeBuild, ECR, CloudWatch, and other services.<br>
Docker installed locally for building images.<br>
Kubernetes cluster for deployment.<br>
kubectl configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.<br>
Git for version control.<br>
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>  
cd UDACITY-DEVOPS-PROJECT  
2. Build Docker Image
To build the Docker image for the application, run:

docker build -t <image-name> .  
3. Push to AWS ECR
Login to your AWS ECR and push the built Docker image:


$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region <your-region>)  
docker tag <image-name>:latest <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:latest  
docker push <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<your-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:latest  
4. Deploy to Kubernetes
Use the provided Kubernetes deployment files to deploy the application:


kubectl apply -f deployment/coworking.yaml  
For local testing, you can use the deployment-local configuration:


kubectl apply -f deployment-local/coworking.yaml  
5. CI/CD Pipeline Setup with CodeBuild
To set up a CI/CD pipeline:

Modify the buildspec.yaml to suit your application.<br>
Set up AWS CodeBuild to trigger builds on push to the main branch of your GitHub repository.<br>
Set up AWS CloudWatch to monitor build and application logs.<br>
Monitoring with AWS CloudWatch
Screenshots provided in the screenshot directory demonstrate how AWS CloudWatch has been set up to monitor the application. Ensure you have permissions to create log groups and log streams in AWS CloudWatch.<br>
